# JDBC HTTP Server

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bjornharrtell/jdbc-http-server.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/bjornharrtell/jdbc-http-server)

Attempt to implement something like the proposal at http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/HTTP_API.

## API Usage

The API is discoverable which means you can access the root resource at /
and follow links to subresources from there but lets say you have a database
named testdb with a table named testtable in the public schema you can then 
do the following operations:

    Retrieve (GET), update (PUT) or delete (DELETE) a single row at:
    /db/testdb/schemas/public/tables/testtable/rows/1

    Retrieve (GET), update (PUT) rows or create a new row (POST) at:
    /db/testdb/schemas/public/tables/testtable/rows

The above resources accepts parameters select, where, limit, offset
and orderby where applicable. Examples:

    GET a maximum of 10 rows where cost>100 at:
    /db/testdb/schemas/public/tables/testtable/rows?where=cost>100&limit=10

The default and currently the only dataformat is JSON. POSTing or PUTing
expects a JSON object with properties corresponding to column names.

## Configuration

### Database access

By default jdbc-http-server will try to find a DataSource from a JDNI Resource named
`jdbc/db`. The name can be overriden with system property `jdbc-http-server.jdni`.

### Logging

The default logging level is INFO. Refer to [Logback](http://logback.qos.ch/) for
further configuration options.

## TODOs

* Other options for database access configuration
* Configurable on/off switch for select and where support (as they can be considered a security risk)
* Configurable on/off switch for update and deletes
* Optional raw SQL support
* Spatial support
* Security configuration allowing partial db access (similar to a firewall)
